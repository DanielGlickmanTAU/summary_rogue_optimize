parallel compute-rouge
have like rouge-2-first, but for multiplications of 2

generate for xsum
generate for cnn/daily
generate with beam search.. n_repeating_ngrams=3
generate with p sampling


try:
    try regular fine tuning..overfit


hyperparams:
    eval metric: rouge-1, rouge-2 rogue-l
    decoding algorithms: beam search, nuclos
    precentile: 0.15
    selection: by prob(roullte)..top


tried:
    select always above average

    append to input text "summarize: " | DOESNT WORK

    force_bos_token_to_be_generated=False | DOESNT MATTER
