get_generated_summaries_with_rouge  and search_validation_loss pass model and tokenizer..


fix get_generated_summaries_with_rouge after see what we have now is running.. dataset len and name and model name should be part of save path...


have like rouge-2-first, but for multiplications of 2

generate for xsum
generate for cnn/daily
generate with beam search.. n_repeating_ngrams=3
generate with p sampling

saving huggingface dataset: careful when switching from xsum to cnn, need to keep dataset file name in cache file

try:
    try regular fine tuning..overfit


hyperparams:
    eval metric: rouge-1, rouge-2 rogue-l
    decoding algorithms: beam search, nuclos
    precentile: 0.15
    selection: by prob(roullte)..top


tried:
    select always above average

    append to input text "summarize: " | DOESNT WORK

    force_bos_token_to_be_generated=False | DOESNT MATTER
